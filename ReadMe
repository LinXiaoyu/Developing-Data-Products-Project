   The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, 
   the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. 
   One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough 
   lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving 
   the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, 
   children, and the upper-class. -- Kaggle

  The data set used in the application is 'ptitanic' from 'rpart.plot' package in R. 
  The description of the data set can be found at: http://artax.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/r-help/library/rpart.plot/html/ptitanic.html. 
  Variables included are passenger class, died or survived, gender, age, number of siblings or spouses aboard,
  number of parents or children aboard. Data transformation were done on some of the variables to simplify the application.
     
  In this Shiny application, you can view the distribution of passengers who survied the tragedy with certain characteristics ('Distribution - Table' tab) 
  and visualize the resutls ('Distribution - Plot' tab), 
  as well as caculate the survival rate of a group of passengers ('Survival Rate' tab). 
  The application can give you a general idea of what sorts of passengers were likely to survive.
     
  Please install R packages of 'ggplot2' and 'plyr' before running this application.
